  |   This is the long-awaited sequel to the legendary N+, rewritten from   |
  |   scratch to be bigger, better, and more beautiful in every way.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer about darting around   |
  |   obstacles, narrowly evading enemies and collecting gold in a          |
  |   beautiful minimalist landscape.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get       |
  |   high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there's a slew of              |
  |   inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from       |
  |   completing your goal.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels,         |
  |   you'll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your    |
  |   fluid movement, you need to 'solve' each level and get to the exit.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In addition to the lengthy and challenging single player campaign,    |
  |   we've packed a ton of features into this one last entry in the N      |
  |   series including:                                                     |

  |   Play a little, or a lot - there's no skill ceiling, so you can        |
  |   always get better and better. N++ is a game that has enough           |
  |   bite-sized gameplay to last you a lifetime.                           |
  |                                                                         |
